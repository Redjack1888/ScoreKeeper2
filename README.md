Project 2 for "Android Basics Scolarship" by Udacity". Baseball Score Keeper Version 2 (with POJO)

## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Adding button code to your app
* Updating views
* Properly scoping variables
* Finding views by their ID
